               <h1>Background</h1> 
               <p>I was born in 1996 and grew up in Spokane, WA. with an awesome family of 4 kids and 2 parents! I left Spokane in 2014 to go to college at Western Washingtion University in Bellingham, WA. There I studied business administration and marketing, as well as rowed for 4 years!</p>
                <h1>Theme</h1>
                <p>You'll notice that the theme of this page is a pallete of earth tones! I love hiking, gardening, and almost any sports activity I can do outside, so naturally these natural colors are my favorite ;)</p>

                <h1>Rowing</h1>
                <p>I had not rowed before starting at Western, however I played a couple of sports in highschool and wanted something similarly competitive in college... I had no clue what I was getting myself into! There are a lot of amazing lessons that rowing gave me, but the best thing I got from rowing were the friends.</p>
                <p>Another great part about rowing is being outside! The feeling of seeing a sunset over perfect water while an hour into a hard workout on that water isn't something very many people are familiar with. Here are a couple of my favorite places that I have rowed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Samish Lake -- Bellingham, Washington.</li>
                    <li>The Charles River -- Boston, Massachusetts</li>
                    <li>Montlake Cut -- Seattle, Washington</li>
                </ol>
