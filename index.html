               <h1>Background</h1> 
               <p>I was born in 1996 and grew up in Spokane, WA. with an awesome family of 4 kids and 2 parents! I left Spokane in 2014 to go to college at Western Washingtion University in Bellingham, WA. There I studied business administration and marketing, as well as rowed for 4 years!</p>
                <h1>Theme</h1>
                <p>You'll notice that the theme of this page is a pallete of earth tones! I love hiking, gardening, and almost any sports activity I can do outside, so naturally these natural colors are my favorite ;)</p>

            <section class="rowing">
                <h1>Rowing</h1>
                <p>I had not rowed before starting at Western, however I played a couple of sports in highschool and wanted something similarly competitive in college... I had no clue what I was getting myself into! There are a lot of amazing lessons that rowing gave me, but the best thing I got from rowing were the friends.</p>
                <p>Another great part about rowing is being outside! The feeling of seeing the sunrise and gliding over perfect water and in the middle of an intense workout, isn't something very many people are familiar with. Here are a couple of my favorite places that I have rowed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Samish Lake -- Bellingham, Washington.</li>
                    <li>The Charles River -- Boston, Massachusetts</li>
                    <li>Montlake Cut -- Seattle, Washington</li>
                </ol>

                <h1>Cooking</h1>
                <p>In 2017 my family went vegan, which in comparison to how/what we previously ate, was a full 180 with our diets. This caused me to get very creative when I cooked, slowly I started to crave different flavors than before and would find ways to turn my old favorite dishes to vegan dishes.</p>
                <p>Now my partner and I are constantly coming up with awesome vegan recipes and sharing them with friends and family through our blog <a href="https://www.chickpleaseclub.com/">Chick, Please!</a> Some of our favorite vegan products that I recommend to people are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Violife cheese -- everything they make is great, but you need to try their sliced provolone and the block of feta cheese!</li>
                    <li>Beyond Burger -- this is most likely obvious to people who try alternative meats often, but beyond burger is better than impossible meats</li>
                    <li>Boom Chicka Pop, Kettle Corn -- this will curve your sweet tooth.</li>
                </ul>
